CSE6040 Computing for Data Analysis:  

50% of final grade consists of weekly homework  
10% Midterm 1  
15% Midterm 2  
25% Final Exam  
3% Extra Credit Project  
All exams are proctored and last 3.5-4.5 hours & open book & open internet (but no AI allowed)  
  

Unfortuanately, I only have access to my solutions for the homework of Week 1-5, and the practice midterm 1. I don't have access to my solutions for Week 6 onwards, so I've uploaded the HW & Midterm Instructor solutions for you to get an idea of the syllabus. Please do not share the homework solutions online.
